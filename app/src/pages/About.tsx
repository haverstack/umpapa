          This is <strong>umpapa</strong>, an app for creating avatars out of swappable parts! (The
          name sounds like a ü•Å.)
        </p>
        <p>
          This app was heavily inspired by{' '}

          </a>
          . I was motivated to create my own version because:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Picrew is a Japanese app and I thought it would be cool to adapt it to an
            English-speaking audience
          </li>
          <li>
            I wanted to make it even easier for artists to create their own avatar generators by
            allowing them to draw directly in the app
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
